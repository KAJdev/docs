**Key characteristics:**

- Fast local networking with bandwidths from 100 Gbps to 3200 Gbps within a single data center
- Static IP assignment for each pod in the cluster
- Environment variables set automatically for coordination between nodes

## Deploy your first Instant Cluster[​](#deploy-your-first-instant-cluster "Direct link to Deploy your first Instant Cluster")

This guide explains how to use Instant Clusters to support larger workloads.

Each pod receives a static IP on the overlay network. The system designates one machine as the primary node by setting `PRIMARY_IP` and `CLUSTER_IP` environment variables. This primary designation simplifies working with multiprocessing libraries that require a primary node.

### Environment variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment variables")

The following environment variables are available in all pods:

| Environment Variable           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PRIMARY_ADDR` / `MASTER_ADDR` | The address of the primary pod                               |
| `PRIMARY_PORT` / `MASTER_PORT` | The port of the primary pod (all ports are available)        |
| `NODE_ADDR`                    | The static IP of this pod within the cluster network         |
| `NODE_RANK`                    | The cluster rank assigned to this pod (set to 0 for primary) |
| `NUM_NODES`                    | Number of pods in the cluster                                |
| `NUM_TRAINERS`                 | Number of GPUs per pod                                       |
| `HOST_NODE_ADDR`               | Defined as `PRIMARY_ADDR:PRIMARY_PORT` for convenience       |

The variables `MASTER_ADDR`/`PRIMARY_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT`/`PRIMARY_PORT` are equivalent. The `MASTER_*` variables provide compatibility with tools that expect these legacy names.

### Network interfaces[​](#network-interfaces "Direct link to Network interfaces")

High-bandwidth interfaces (`eth1`, `eth2`, etc.) handle inter-node communication, while the management interface (`eth0`) manages external traffic. The NCCL environment variable `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` uses all available interfaces by default. The `PRIMARY_ADDR` corresponds to `eth1` to enable launching and bootstrapping distributed processes.

### Example PyTorch implementation[​](#example-pytorch-implementation "Direct link to Example PyTorch implementation")

```
export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth1torchrun \  --nproc_per_node=$NUM_TRAINERS \  --nnodes=$NUM_NODES \  --node_rank=$NODE_RANK \  --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR \  --master_port=$MASTER_PORT \  main.py
```

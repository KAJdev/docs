<Note>
  Legacy API keys generated before November 11, 2024 have either Read/Write or Read Only access to GraphQL based on what was set for that key. All legacy keys have full access to AI API. To improve security, generate a new key with Restricted permission and select the minimum permission needed for your use case.
</Note>

## Generate[​](#generate "Direct link to Generate")

To create an API key:

1. From the console, select **Settings**.

2. Under **API Keys**, choose **+ Create API Key**.

3. Select the permission. If you choose **Restricted** permission, you can customize access for each API:

   * **None**: No access
   * (AI API only) **Restricted**: Custom access to specific endpoints. No access is default.
   * **Read/Write**: Full access
   * **Read Only**: Read access without write access

   <Warning>
     Select the minimum permission needed for your use case. Only allow full access to GraphQL when absolutely necessary for automations like creating or managing RunPod resources outside of Serverless endpoints.
   </Warning>

4. Choose **Create**.

<Note>
  Once your API key is generated, keep it secure. Treat it like a password and avoid sharing it in insecure environments.

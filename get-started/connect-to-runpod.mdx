## CLI[​](#cli "Direct link to CLI")

You can use RunPod's CLI [runpodctl](https://github.com/runpod/runpodctl) to manage Pods and for development.

All Pods come with `runpodctl` installed with a Pod-scoped API key, which makes managing your Pods easier through the command line.

* [GraphQL](/sdks/graphql/manage-pods)

When you create a Pod, it comes with runpodctl installed and configured with a Pod-scoped API key. You can also run runpodctl locally.

To install runpodctl on your local machine, run the appropriate command for your operating system.

* macOS
* Linux
* Windows

```
brew install runpod/runpodctl/runpodctl
```

```
wget -qO- cli.runpod.net | sudo bash
```

```
wget https://github.com/runpod/runpodctl/releases/download/v1.14.3/runpodctl-windows-amd64.exe -O runpodctl.exe
```

## Configuring runpodctl[â€‹](#configuring-runpodctl "Direct link to Configuring runpodctl")

Before you can use runpodctl, you must configure an API key. To create a new API key, complete the following steps:

1. In the web interface, go to your [**Settings**](https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings).
2. Expand **API Keys** and click the **+ API Key** button.
3. Select **Read** or **Read & Write** permissions.
4. Click **Create**.

<Note>
  Keep your API key secret. Anyone with the key can gain full access to your account.
</Note>

Now that you've created an API key, run the following command to add it to runpodctl:

```
runpodctl config --apiKey your-api-key
```

You should see something similar to the following output:

```
saved apiKey into config file: /Users/runpod/.runpod/config.toml
```

Now that you've configured an API key, check that runpodctl installed successfully. Run the following command:

```
runpodctl version
```

You should see which version is installed.

```
runpodctl v1.13.0
```

If at any point you need help with a command, you can use the `--help` flag to see documentation on the command you're running.

```
runpodctl --help
```

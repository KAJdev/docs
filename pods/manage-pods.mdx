### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

If you are using the [RunPod CLI](/runpodctl/install-runpodctl), you'll need to set your API key in the configuration.

```
runpodctl config --apiKey $RUNPOD_API_KEY
```

Replace `$RUNPOD_API_KEY` with your RunPod API key.

Once your API key is set, you can manage your infrastructure.

If you're not sure which Pod meets your needs, see [Choose a Pod](/pods/choose-a-pod).

## Create Pods[​](#create-pods "Direct link to Create Pods")

* Web
* Command line

1. Navigate to [Pods](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) and select **+ Deploy**.

2. Choose between **GPU** and **CPU**.

3. Customize your an instance by setting up the following:

   1. (optional) Specify a Network volume.
   2. Select an instance type. For example, **A40**.
   3. (optional) Provide a template. For example, **RunPod Pytorch**.
   4. (GPU only) Specify your compute count.

4. Review your configuration and select **Deploy On-Demand**.

To create a Pod using the CLI, use the `runpodctl create pods` command.

```
runpodctl create pods \  --name hello-world \  --gpuType "NVIDIA A40" \  --imageName "runpod/pytorch:3.10-2.0.0-117" \  --containerDiskSize 10 \  --volumeSize 100 \  --args "bash -c 'mkdir /testdir1 && /start.sh'"
```

<Check>
  RunPod supports custom [templates](/pods/templates/overview) that allow you to specify your own Dockerfile. By creating a Dockerfile, you can build a [custom Docker image](/tutorials/introduction/containers/overview) with your specific dependencies and configurations. This ensures that your applications are reliable and portable across different environments.

Charges occur after the Pod build is complete.

## Stop a Pod[​](#stop-a-pod "Direct link to Stop a Pod")

* Web
* Command line

1. Click the stop icon.
2. Confirm by clicking the **Stop Pod** button.

To stop a Pod, enter the following command.

```
runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

### Stop a Pod after a specific time[​](#stop-a-pod-after-a-specific-time "Direct link to Stop a Pod after a specific time")

You can also stop a Pod after a specific amount of time. For example, the following command sleeps for 2 hours, and then stops the Pod.

* SSH
* Web terminal

Use the following command to stop a Pod after 2 hours:

```
sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID &
```

This command uses sleep to wait for 2 hours before executing the `runpodctl stop pod` command to stop the Pod. The `&` at the end runs the command in the background, allowing you to continue using the SSH session.

To stop a Pod after 2 hours using the web terminal, enter:

```
nohup bash -c "sleep 2h; runpodctl stop pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID" &
```

`nohup` ensures the process continues running if you close the web terminal window.

<Warning>
  You are charged for storing idle Pods. If you do not need to store your Pod, be sure to terminate it next.
</Warning>

## Start a Pod[​](#start-a-pod "Direct link to Start a Pod")

You can resume a pod that has been stopped.

* Web
* Command line

1. Navigate to the **Pods** page.
2. Select your Pod you want to resume.
3. Select **Start**.

Your Pod will resume.

To start a single Pod, enter the command `runpodctl start pod`. You can pass the environment variable `RUNPOD_POD_ID` to identify each Pod.

```
runpodctl start pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

## Terminate a Pod[​](#terminate-a-pod "Direct link to Terminate a Pod")

<Warning>
  Terminating a Pod permanently deletes all data outside your [Network volume](/pods/storage/create-network-volumes). Be sure you've saved any data you want to access again.
</Warning>

* Web
* Command line

1. Select the hamburger menu at the bottom of the Pod you want to terminate.
2. Click **Terminate Pod**.
3. Confirm by clicking the **Yes** button.

To remove a single Pod, enter the following command.

```
runpodctl remove pod $RUNPOD_POD_ID
```

You can also remove Pods in bulk. For example, the following command terminates up to 40 pods with the name `my-bulk-task`.

```
runpodctl remove pods my-bulk-task --podCount 40
```

## List Pods[​](#list-pods "Direct link to List Pods")

If you're using the command line, enter the following command to list your pods.

```
runpodctl get pod
```

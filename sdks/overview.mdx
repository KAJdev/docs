## Interacting with Serverless Endpoints[​](#interacting-with-serverless-endpoints "Direct link to Interacting with Serverless Endpoints")

Once deployed, serverless functions is exposed as an Endpoints, you can allow external applications to interact with them through HTTP requests.

#### Interact with Serverless Endpoints:[​](#interact-with-serverless-endpoints "Direct link to Interact with Serverless Endpoints:")

Your Serverless Endpoints works similarly to an HTTP request. You will need to provide an Endpoint Id and a reference to your API key to complete requests.

## Infrastructure management[​](#infrastructure-management "Direct link to Infrastructure management")

The RunPod SDK facilitates the programmatic creation, configuration, and management of various infrastructure components, including Pods, Templates, and Endpoints.

### Managing Pods[​](#managing-pods "Direct link to Managing Pods")

Pods are the fundamental building blocks in RunPod, representing isolated environments for running applications.

#### Manage Pods:[​](#manage-pods "Direct link to Manage Pods:")

1. **Create a Pod**: Use the SDK to instantiate a new Pod with the desired configuration.
2. **Configure the Pod**: Adjust settings such as GPU, memory allocation, and network access according to your needs.
3. **Deploy Applications**: Deploy your applications or services within the Pod.
4. **Monitor and scale**: Utilize the SDK to monitor Pod performance and scale resources as required.

### Manage Templates and Endpoints[​](#manage-templates-and-endpoints "Direct link to Manage Templates and Endpoints")

Templates define the base environment for Pods, while Endpoints enable external access to services running within Pods.

#### Use Templates and Endpoints:[​](#use-templates-and-endpoints "Direct link to Use Templates and Endpoints:")

1. **Create a Template**: Define a Template that specifies the base configuration for Pods.
2. **Instantiate Pods from Templates**: Use the Template to create Pods with a consistent environment.
3. **Expose Services via Endpoints**: Configure Endpoints to allow external access to applications running in Pods.

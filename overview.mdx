## Serverless[​](#serverless "Direct link to Serverless")

[Serverless](/serverless/overview) offers **pay-per-second** serverless computing with **built-in autoscaling** for production workloads.

Use Serverless to:

* **Deploy AI workloads** with low cold-start times and robust security.
* Build and expose **REST API endpoints** with autoscaling.
* Queue jobs efficiently **without managing infrastructure**.

## Pods[​](#pods "Direct link to Pods")

[Pods](/pods/overview) allow you to run **containerized workloads** on dedicated GPU or CPU instances.

RunPod offers two types of Pods:

* **Secure Cloud:** Operates in T3/T4 data centers, providing high reliability and security.
* **Community Cloud**: Connects individual compute providers to users through a vetted, secure peer-to-peer system.

title: "Build Docker Images on RunPod with Bazel"
description: "RunPod's GPU Pods use custom Docker images to run your code. This means you can't directly spin up your own Docker instance or build Docker containers on a GPU Pod. Tools like Docker Compose are also unavailable."
---

This limitation can be frustrating when you need to create custom Docker images for your RunPod templates.

Fortunately, many use cases can be addressed by creating a custom template with the desired Docker image.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the [Bazel](https://bazel.build) build tool to build and push Docker images from inside a RunPod container.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to build custom Docker images on RunPod and push them to Docker Hub for use in your own templates.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:

* A Docker Hub account and access token for authenticating the docker login command
* Enough volume for your image to be built

## Create a Pod[​](#create-a-pod "Direct link to Create a Pod")

1. Navigate to [Pods](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) and select **+ Deploy**.

2. Choose between **GPU** and **CPU**.

3. Customize your an instance by setting up the following:

   1. (optional) Specify a Network volume.
   2. Select an instance type. For example, **A40**.
   3. (optional) Provide a template. For example, **RunPod Pytorch**.
   4. (GPU only) Specify your compute count.

4. Review your configuration and select **Deploy On-Demand**.

For more information, see [Manage Pods](/pods/manage-pods#start-a-pod).

Wait for the Pod to spin up then connect to your Pod through the Web Terminal:

1. Select **Connect**.
2. Choose **Start Web Terminal** and then **Connect to Web Terminal**.
3. Enter your username and password.

Now you can clone the example GitHub repository

## Clone the example GitHub repository[​](#clone-the-example-github-repository "Direct link to Clone the example GitHub repository")

Clone the example code repository that demonstrates building Docker images with Bazel:

```
git clone https://github.com/therealadityashankar/build-docker-in-runpod.git && cd build-docker-in-runpod
```

## Install dependencies[​](#install-dependencies "Direct link to Install dependencies")

Install the required dependencies inside the Runpod container:

Update packages and install sudo:

```
apt update && apt install -y sudo
```

Install Docker using the convenience script:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

Log in to Docker using an access token:

1. Go to [https://hub.docker.com/settings/security](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) and click "New Access Token".
2. Enter a description like "Runpod Token" and select "Read/Write" permissions.
3. Click "Generate" and copy the token that appears.
4. In the terminal, run:

```
docker login -u <your-username>
```

When prompted, paste in the access token you copied instead of your password.

Install Bazel via the Bazelisk version manager:

```
wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.20.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64chmod +x bazelisk-linux-amd64  sudo cp ./bazelisk-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/bazel
```

## Configure the Bazel Build[​](#configure-the-bazel-build "Direct link to Configure the Bazel Build")

First, install nano if it’s not already installed and open the `BUILD.bazel` file for editing:

```
sudo apt install nanonano BUILD.bazel
```

Replace the `{YOUR_USERNAME}` placeholder with your Docker Hub username in the `BUILD.bazel` file:

```
[label BUILD.bazel]oci_push(    name = "push_custom_image",    image = ":custom_image",    repository = "index.docker.io/{YOUR_USERNAME}/custom_image",    remote_tags = ["latest"])
```

## Build and Push the Docker Image[​](#build-and-push-the-docker-image "Direct link to Build and Push the Docker Image")

Run the bazel command to build the Docker image and push it to your Docker Hub account:

```
bazel run //:push_custom_image
```

Once the command completes, go to [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/) and log in. You should see a new repository called `custom_image` containing the Docker image you just built.

You can now reference this custom image in your own Runpod templates.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

In this tutorial, you learned how to use Bazel to build and push Docker images from inside RunPod containers. By following the steps outlined, you can now create and utilize custom Docker images for your RunPod templates. The techniques demonstrated can be further expanded to build more complex images, providing a flexible solution for your containerization needs on RunPod.
